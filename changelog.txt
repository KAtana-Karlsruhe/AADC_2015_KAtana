	renamed folder of sensor unbundle filter
	deleted additional trunk level in the folder structure

v.1.2.1.
	configs			changed the paths for the media descriptions in the system.xml 
	moved the imageprocessing filters to adtfUser
	jury module		added import of xml (maneuver list)
	driver module 	added import of xml (maneuver list)
	fixed some bugs
	modified the defalut calibration file for the xtion: xtionSettings.xml

v.1.3.0.
	attitude converter module 		fixed bug in the order of yaw pitch roll 
	marker detection filter 		added filter for detection of bitcodes which are used for traffic signs (based on aruco lib)
	road sign evaluator				added filter only for demonstration purpose to show results of marker detection
	traffic sign detection filter	algorithm for detection and classification modified; matching is deletet, sign are classified only by shape and color
	fixed some minor bugs in the cmake structure
	tests 							added some automated tests for the adtf filters
	xtionSettings.xml				lowered the default resolution for the depthimage to not overload the usb controller
	reorganized the folder structure for adtfUser and adtfBase
	arduino communication filter	revised complete filter 
	
v.1.3.1
	mediaSample timestamps		fixed a bug
	Jury Modul 					transmit data eatch 250 ms
	DDL Descriptions			revised 
	
v.1.3.2.
	xtion Filter				option added to set the values of the depth image of the xtion to millimeters
	revised the getting and putting of data to and from the mediasamples in each filter. Now a macro is used which cannot locked the sample out of its scope
    sensors filter              ir rear center media description fixed
	
v.1.3.3.
	revised the getting and putting of data to and from the mediasamples in each filter again. Now the correct scopes are set
	BaseConfig					revised layout
	JuryConfig                  revised layout
	Marker Detection			the area of the detected sign is now correctly transmitted
	road sign evaluator			added this filter to show the result of the marker detection
	arduinoActuators				modifed the setting of the mediaDescriptors because the OnTypeChanged call cannot not be used with In-/Outports in Raw Mode.
	arduinoCommunication		fixed a bug in the thread procedure (invalid high cpu usage)
	Jury Filter 				added a button to stop the sending of the samples with EmergencyStop
